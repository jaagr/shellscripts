0.1.1

Added this changelog.

Added an internal function for getting absolute paths in the generic
script loader-extended.sh.  Normal shells are now independent of the
external commands getabspath and awk.

Fixed detection of the optional external command getabspath.  This time
also, it will only be used if the newly added internal function doesn't
work for the shell.

No other changes were made in the other scripts.
